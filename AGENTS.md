# telegram-agent-bot: Codex Project Rules

This supplements [docs/AGENTS-global.md](/home/tinker/telegram-agent-bot/docs/AGENTS-global.md)
with repo-specific failure patterns and workflows.

## Use These Local Skills

For high-risk work, open the matching local skill before changing code:

- `docs/codex-skills/contract-change-audit/SKILL.md`
- `docs/codex-skills/durable-state-hardening/SKILL.md`
- `docs/codex-skills/invariant-test-builder/SKILL.md`
- `docs/codex-skills/progress-ux-audit/SKILL.md`

## Pluggable Subsystem Architecture (Port + Factory Rule)

This repo has three categories of pluggable subsystem: **surface** (conversation
output transport), **storage** (session persistence), and **provider** (AI execution
engine). Every pluggable subsystem follows the same architectural pattern without
exception.

### The Rule

**No orchestration code names a specific surface, storage, or provider
implementation.** Orchestration code (worker_dispatch, delivery, handlers) imports
only abstract ports and calls only factory functions. It never imports
`TelegramConversationIO`, `RegistryConversationIO`, `SqliteSessionStore`, or any
other concrete class directly.

### Required Shape for Every Pluggable Subsystem

```
app/transports/ports.py          ← abstract port: ConversationIO / InteractionSurface
app/transports/telegram_adapter.py  ← concrete: TelegramConversationIO
app/transports/registry_adapter.py  ← concrete: RegistryConversationIO
app/transports/factory.py        ← factory: create_outbound_surface(conversation_ref, ...)
```

The factory is the single place that decides which implementation to construct.
Adding a new surface (iMessage, Slack, SMS) means adding a new adapter and a branch
inside the factory. The orchestration layer is not touched.

### How To Add a New Surface

1. Create `app/transports/<name>_adapter.py` implementing `InteractionSurface`.
2. Add a branch in `app/transports/factory.py:create_outbound_surface()`.
3. Add a branch in `app/transports/factory.py:trust_tier_for_source()` if the
   surface has distinct trust semantics.
4. Add factory tests: `test_factory_<name>_ref_produces_<name>_surface`.
5. Do not touch `worker_dispatch`, `delivery.py`, or any handler.

### Trust Tiers

Trust determination is a factory concern, not an orchestration concern.
`worker_dispatch` calls `factory.trust_tier_for_source(source, user, config=cfg)`.
`factory.py` delegates to `app/access.trust_tier(config, user)`. Inline `source`
string comparisons for trust do not belong in orchestration code — they belong in
the factory.

## Bug Classes From Project History

These patterns caused repeated bugs. Check them on every nontrivial
change.

1. **Parallel path drift.** One path gets fixed, another stays stale:
   command vs callback, normal vs approval/retry, decorated handlers
   vs special cases.
2. **Raw state instead of resolved state.** `session.active_skills`
   instead of the resolved list, `cfg.working_dir` instead of
   `resolved.working_dir`, raw session/config in safety-sensitive or
   user-visible paths.
3. **Test doubles not matching production shape.** Fakes that omit
   public fields or methods production code reads.
4. **Testing implementation instead of contracts.** Tests that only
   prove “the code does what I wrote” instead of “all entry points obey
   the invariant.”
5. **Component isolation hiding interaction bugs.** Heartbeat alone,
   provider progress alone, transport alone — but not the interaction.
6. **Subprocess and resource leaks.** Spawn without kill+wait, leaked
   SQLite handles, leaked descriptors on error paths.
7. **Decorator/wrapper swallowing handler behavior.** Eager callback
   answers, `finally` marking work `done` when success and failure
   should differ.
8. **Leaking internals to users.** Provider names, thread IDs, session
   IDs, internal terminology, raw provider errors.
9. **State-transition accounting failures.** Work marked `done` when it
   should be `failed` or replayable. Early returns skipping cleanup.
10. **Recovery loop.** A fix in replay/recovery can create an infinite
    loop if the recovery path itself re-enters the same durable state
    after interruption. Any change to replay, recovery, or claimed-item
    handling must be tested across four cases: interrupted original run,
    interrupted replay, failed replay, successful replay.
11. **Completion-owner drift.** In this repo, handler code,
    `_chat_lock`, `worker_dispatch()`, and `worker_loop()` all
    participate in work-item completion. Any change to completion
    semantics must include an explicit owner table: who marks `done`,
    who marks `failed`, who marks `claimed`, and what happens when the
    owner is interrupted.
12. **Ambiguous provider error signals.** Codex and Claude do not
    expose equally specific failure signals. Provider-specific reset
    behavior (clearing `thread_id`, resetting `started`) must be
    justified from the provider's error contract, not inferred from
    `rc != 0`. A generic error on a resumed run does not prove the
    resume itself is broken; it may be a transient failure on a healthy
    session.
13. **Telegram message-chain test blindness.** `reply_text()` returns
    a new status message; `TelegramProgress.edit_text()` lands on that
    returned object. Tests that inspect only `msg.replies` on the
    original message are blind to status edits. Use
    `_StickyReplyMessage` (or equivalent) when testing flows that
    create a status message and then update it via progress.
14. **Surface-specific logic in orchestration code.** `worker_dispatch`
    and delivery handlers must never import or branch on a specific
    surface adapter. If you add `if conversation_ref.startswith(...):`
    or `if source == "registry":` in an orchestration file, you have
    violated the port+factory rule. Put the branch in the factory.
15. **send_message bypassing send_text.** On `TelegramConversationIO`,
    `send_message()` must delegate to `send_text()` so that the
    `replies` list is populated and the returned handle is a
    `TelegramEditableMessageHandle`. Tests that call `send_message`
    and inspect `bot.messages` directly are blind to this bypass.
16. **Silent recovery notice failure.** A new surface that inherits the
    `InteractionSurface.send_recovery_notice()` no-op without overriding
    it will never inform users that interrupted work needs replay. Every
    surface with a user-facing UI channel must override it.

## Engineering Principles

These apply to all code changes in this repo without exception.

### Extend Before Inventing

Before adding a new module, function, or abstraction, find the existing
seam that already owns that concern. Extend it. If no seam exists,
create an interface/protocol first, then implement it — never add a
concrete-only class that bypasses an existing abstraction boundary.

### Interfaces Before Implementations

Every new pluggable component (store backend, surface adapter, provider,
ingress handler) must have a Protocol or ABC defined before the first
concrete implementation lands. The protocol lives in its own file (e.g.
`store_base.py`, `ports.py`). Concrete implementations import and
satisfy the protocol. Orchestration code imports only the protocol,
never the concrete class.

### No Hand-Rolled Infrastructure

Use battle-tested libraries for concerns that are not unique to this
project: `psycopg` for Postgres connections, `psycopg_pool` for
pooling, `pydantic` for request validation, `python-statemachine` for
FSMs, `starlette` sessions for auth. Do not implement connection pools,
JSON schema validators, state machines, or session middleware from
scratch.

### No Parallel Paths for the Same Concern

If the transport store already owns work-item persistence, new ingress
paths (webhook, registry delivery, future Slack adapter) must write
through the same transport facade — not a second queue, a second table,
or a second state machine. If the existing facade is insufficient,
extend it.

### Migration Fidelity

Versioned schema migrations are historical replay steps, not normal
code. Each migration must reference column and table names as they
existed at that version, not as they exist in the current schema.
Rewriting historical migrations to use current names breaks upgrade
paths from older databases.

### Transport Contract Changes Require Full Blast-Radius Audit

When changing a transport facade return type or status value (e.g.
`"busy"` → `"queued"`), grep the entire codebase for every consumer
of that status before starting implementation. Surface call sites
(Telegram handlers, registry bridge, registry delivery, tests) all
encode the old contract. Change the transport implementation and every
consumer in the same commit or coordinated sequence — never leave a
half-migrated contract.

### Stale-Claim Detection Is Age-Based

A claimed item is stale only when `claimed_at + lease_ttl < now`. Never
treat `worker_id != current_worker_id` as evidence of staleness — in
multi-worker deployments every other worker's live claims would be
incorrectly recovered. The optimistic update guard
(`WHERE worker_id = ? AND claimed_at = ?`) uses the stale row's
original values for race protection, not for staleness detection.

### Queueing Is a First-Class Runtime Contract

If this repo says a surface or runtime path is queued, the transport
store must durably accept and enqueue the work item. Do not simulate
queueing with terminal `chat_busy`, `retry_later`, or reject-and-
redeliver behavior. When changing fresh-message admission from reject
to queue, update the transport store, Telegram/registry call sites, and
all affected tests in the same slice.

### FSM Review Before Durable Queue Changes

Any change to durable queueing, stale-claim recovery, replay, or
admission policy must start with an audit of the existing
`python-statemachine` transport workflow and its tests. Confirm the
machine still expresses the intended contract: multiple queued fresh
items, one claimed item per conversation, replay-only stale recovery,
and correct coexistence of queued fresh work with `pending_recovery`.
If the contract is missing, extend the workflow abstraction and tests
first; do not patch around it with ad hoc SQL branches.

### Recovered Work Is Replay-Notice Only

Stale claimed work must never auto-rerun on recovery. Recovery
transitions should move the item into the existing replay/discard flow
(`dispatch_mode = 'recovery'` to `pending_recovery`) so the user
explicitly chooses what happens next. Automatic continuation risks
circular loops and false actions after restart.

## Repo-Specific Bug Reports

When writing a bug report for this repo:

- Lead with the exact false user-visible behavior or violated durable
  contract.
- Anchor the report with `update_id`, `chat_id`, matching
  `journalctl` lines, and the relevant `updates` / `work_items` or
  `sessions` row state.
- For work-item and recovery bugs, state whether the item was fresh
  same-boot, stale claimed, `pending_recovery`, or true restart
  recovery, and prove that classification from durable state.
- Separate symptom, violated contract, root cause, scope,
  non-solutions, testing strategy, and acceptance criteria.
- If the bot told the user something false, say that explicitly.
- Name equivalent ingress paths that may share the same ownership or
  state-transition bug.

## Repo-Specific Process

- Recommend the strongest justified fix as the default path. Prefer the
  option that improves correctness, reliability, maintainability,
  performance, safety, or operator usability, even when it is harder.
  Do not present a weaker shortcut as equally valid unless the user
  explicitly asks for tradeoffs or the task is truly bounded to copy or
  docs.
- Ingress parity checklist for this repo: message, command, callback,
  admin, CLI, approval, retry.
- Provider-neutral language in all user-facing text: no provider names,
  no internal IDs, no implementation terminology.
- For durable workflows, specify possible states, who transitions them,
  what happens on failure, early return, and cancellation.
- **Urgent mitigation vs full fix.** If production pressure forces a
  mitigation, label it explicitly as mitigation, define what contract
  remains unresolved, and do not close the original bug until the
  unresolved contract has its own repro and test.
- Update the status doc only after the code and tests confirm runtime
  behavior.
