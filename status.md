# Octopus CLI Implementation Status

## Baseline

- Track: `./octopus` unified CLI
- Plan: `PLAN-octopus-cli.md`
- Baseline branch: `feature/skills`
- Baseline goal: replace `guided_start.sh`, `shared_start.sh`, and `lib_env.sh` with a single `./octopus` entrypoint and `.deploy/`-based state model.

## Slice Log

- Complete: Slice 1 split `lib_env.sh` into focused libraries.
  Scope:
  - created `scripts/lib/bot.sh`, `scripts/lib/docker.sh`, `scripts/lib/provider.sh`, `scripts/lib/ui.sh`, `scripts/lib/state.sh`, and `scripts/lib/registry.sh`
  - moved all existing `lib_env.sh` functions into the focused libraries
  - kept `lib_env.sh` as a temporary shim
  - rewired `start_instance.sh`, `stop_instance.sh`, `logs_instance.sh`, `provider_login.sh`, and `provider_status.sh` to source focused libraries directly
  Tests:
  - `bash -n scripts/lib/bot.sh scripts/lib/docker.sh scripts/lib/provider.sh scripts/lib/ui.sh scripts/lib/state.sh scripts/lib/registry.sh scripts/lib_env.sh scripts/app/start_instance.sh scripts/app/stop_instance.sh scripts/app/logs_instance.sh scripts/provider/provider_login.sh scripts/provider/provider_status.sh`
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -n 4 tests/test_operator_scripts.py`
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -n 4`
  Direct checks:
  - `./scripts/app/start_instance.sh` with no env file prints the expected `.env.bot` creation guidance
  - `./scripts/app/stop_instance.sh` with no env file prints the expected `.env.bot` creation guidance
  - `./scripts/provider/provider_status.sh` with no env file prints the expected `.env.bot` creation guidance
  Verified:
  - the library split landed without changing current startup/provider behavior
  - the temporary shim preserves the existing operator-script test contract while callers move to the focused libraries
  - full suite remained green after the refactor
- In progress: Slice 2 introduce `.deploy/` state layout and slug-based wrappers.
  Scope:
  - add `scripts/lib/state.sh` queries and `.deploy/` directory helpers
  - add `normalize_slug()` to `scripts/lib/bot.sh`
  - rewrite `bot_compose()` around `.deploy/bots/<slug>/.env`
  - add `registry_compose()` and `provider_compose()`
  - update `start_instance.sh`, `stop_instance.sh`, and `logs_instance.sh` to prefer slug-based `.deploy` bots while keeping the old instance fallback for this slice only
  Tests:
  - `bash -n scripts/lib/bot.sh scripts/lib/state.sh scripts/lib/docker.sh scripts/app/start_instance.sh scripts/app/stop_instance.sh scripts/app/logs_instance.sh`
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -n 4`
  Direct checks:
  - created a temporary `.deploy/bots/slice2-test/.env` and verified `start_instance.sh` / `stop_instance.sh` resolved the slug-based bot path instead of asking for `.env.bot`
  - confirmed ordinary bot commands no longer require registry env interpolation just to parse the compose file
  Verified:
  - `.deploy/` is now the canonical state root for the new wrappers
  - slug-based low-level bot scripts work while the old instance fallback remains available for this transitional slice
  - the compose wrappers now inject temporary registry placeholders for non-registry bot/profile commands, avoiding unrelated compose parse failures
